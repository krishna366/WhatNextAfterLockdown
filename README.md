# WhatNextAfterLockdown
Once India comes out after COVID-19 lockdown what are the possible challenges it is going face and how to face them?

It All Started with a casual discussion on BITS 2001 Whatsapp group. What will happen next once the lockdown is lifted? Anyone thinking about it and working on possible if-this-then-do-that scenarios? We had a quick web meeting and listed some problems/issues which we might face once lockdown is lifted in India. We have decided to open source the discussion so that everyone who is locked up in their house during lockdown will be able to contribute based on his / her experience, intellect & far sight.

# Isn't it the duty of Government to decide & execute what to do after lockdown?

Before answering this lets us try to understand the scenario in India after lockdown
1. Economic activity would have reached rock bottom. Might cause job loss or pay cuts.
2. Doctors & Health Workers would have overstretched.
3. Police & Law and Order Mechanism will still have a lot in its hands to relax lockdown in phased manner.
4. Executive Authority will be handling unexpected issues raised from lockdown itself.
5. People coming out from lockdown will be anxious about their immediate future.

So the impact of post lockdown will be as sudden as the lockdown and the same authorities need to handle them with limited overstretched resources. So it is the duty of everyone who can contribute to list all the possible challenges, ways to handle them and present them to relevant authorities.

# What is the expected outcome for this initiative?

1. List of immediate, short-term and long term challenges once lockdown is lifted.
2. Possible solutions for these challenges.
3. Forwarding both the challenges & solutions to relevant authorities for their consideration while planning for post lockdown measures.

# Will authorities will implement the solutions we suggest?

Every public office which will be working for the betterment of people will definitely review possible challenges due to lockdown. Solutions may or may not be considered because most of the solutions will not be considering the implementation challenges which only the relevant authorities will be aware of.

# Why GitHub instead of social media?

We want to keep this away from social media warriors whose only contribution is likes & comments. We picked Git because it is one of the best collaboration tools to manage contributions from a diverse set of people without compromising the original project and credits for every contributor. Github.com is a free hosting service of git.

# How do you operate?

Anyone can fork this repository, add their contribution and send a pull request. Our core team will meet daily from 8 PM to 8.40 PM in a Zoom call to accept/reject pull requests.

Once the lockdown is over will send the consolidated report to relevant authorities.

# What do you mean by relevant authorities?

We use rational to decide who is a relevant authority. Suppose we get issues & solutions which are applicable for the majority of Indian we will send the final report to Prime Minister Office for their consideration. If we have ended up with Hyderabad specific issues & solutions we will send them Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation commissioner for his consideration.

# This looks interesting. How can I know more details?
