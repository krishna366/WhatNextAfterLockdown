#WhiteCollorMentalHealth

As part of this initiative we have decided to meet every day via zoom call to discuss various mental health issues white collor workers might face once they are back to work post lockdown.

#Why only WhiteCollor ?

If a white collor employee is at mental health he will give job to ten different blue collor workers. So directly helping few people will indirectly help so many people.

#What is the end goal ?

Probably 100 possible minor to major issues which white collor employees might face once lockdown is removed and they report back to work with some probable solutions to them. 

#Who will benfit for this exercise ?

Startups, People Managers, HR Leaders who are concerned about their team members mental health.
